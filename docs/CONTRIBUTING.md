## Development environment setup

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt
   ```

2. Build and run the project

   For combined backend + frontend development:

   ```sh
   ./mvnw quarkus:dev
   ```

   For frontend-only development:

   ```sh
   cd src/main/webui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   For full verification (including tests):

   ```sh
   ./mvnw verify

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new feature?Take a look at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt/discussions) to see if it's already being discussed.  You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt/issues). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

### How to submit a Pull Request

1. Search our repository for open or closed
   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt/pulls)
   that relate to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the project
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing_feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing_feature'`) Startpunkt uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), so please follow the specification in your commit messages.
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/amazing_feature`)
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt/compare?expand=1)

## Release Process

Startpunkt uses GitHub Actions to automate the release process. To create a new release:

1. Navigate to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/ullbergm/startpunkt/actions/workflows/perform-release.yml) in the repository
2. Click "Run workflow" on the "Perform Release" workflow
3. Select the release type:
   - **patch**: Increments the patch version (e.g., 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.1.1)
   - **minor**: Increments the minor version (e.g., 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0)
   - **major**: Increments the major version (e.g., 2.1.0 ‚Üí 3.0.0)
   - **custom**: Allows you to specify a custom version number
4. If you selected "custom", enter the desired version number (e.g., 2.3.0)
5. Click "Run workflow"

The workflow will:
- Calculate the release version based on your selection
- Run `mvnw release:prepare` to prepare the release
- Run `mvnw release:perform` to complete the release
- Push the release tag to the repository
- Trigger the automatic GitHub release creation with changelog

**Note**: Only maintainers with write access can trigger releases.

### Automated Changelog Generation

When a new version tag (e.g., `v2.2.4`) is pushed to the repository, the Release workflow automatically:

1. Collects all merged pull requests since the last release
2. Categorizes them based on conventional commit types in PR titles
3. Generates a structured changelog
4. Creates a GitHub release with the changelog

**Changelog Categories:**

The changelog groups changes into the following categories based on the conventional commit type:

- üöÄ **Features** (`feat:`) - New features and enhancements
- üêõ **Fixes** (`fix:`) - Bug fixes
- üìö **Documentation** (`docs:`) - Documentation changes
- üî® **Refactoring** (`refactor:`) - Code refactoring
- üß™ **Tests** (`test:`) - Test additions or modifications
- üì¶ **Dependencies** (`chore:`) - Dependency updates and maintenance
- üöÄ **CI/CD** (`ci:`) - CI/CD workflow changes
- üé® **Styling** (`style:`) - Code style changes
- ‚ö° **Performance** (`perf:`) - Performance improvements
- üîß **Build** (`build:`) - Build system changes
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Reverts** (`revert:`) - Reverted changes

**Best Practices for PR Titles:**

To ensure your contributions are properly categorized in the changelog:

1. Use conventional commit format in your PR titles: `type(scope): description`
2. Choose the appropriate type from the list above
3. Keep the description clear and concise
4. Examples:
   - `feat(api): add theme customization endpoint`
   - `fix(ui): correct bookmark sorting order`
   - `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
   - `chore(deps): bump quarkus to 3.8.0`

The changelog configuration is maintained in `.github/workflows/changelog/configuration.json`.
